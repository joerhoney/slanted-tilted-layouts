            <h3>Using Tailwind</h3>
            <p>As we don't want to lose time reinventing the wheel and we do want to exercise best practices, let's use a utility-first CSS library to do the heavy lifting for us. I rejected Tailwind for several years, thinking it was too similar to inline styles. But Tailwind at least addresses one major deal-killer with inline styles, which is no query support. What good is a layout today that isn't responsive?</p>
            <p>The initial approach here was to introduce supplementary classes which would cover the few things Tailwind can't really do. But as I gradiently learned more about Tailwind, the amount of custom CSS needed kept dwindling, and I ended up deleting over half of it. But this made me apprciate what Tailwind does even more and I learned a LOT more about Sass and CSS as well (including why some CSS preprocessors are not recommended with Tailwind). So I don't regret having gone to such great lengths only to undo a bunch of it.</p>
            <p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: Please note that this is a work in progress and could be better optimized. New interations of this experiment will aim to utilize Tailwind as recommended by its <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation">documentation</a>.</p>

            <h2>Slanted Boxes</h2>
            <p>Let's start with the easier one. "Slanted" boxes are pretty straight forward. Using Tailwind we need the <code>transform</code> class to do any slanting (or any box shape manipulation). It doesn't do anything by itself, it just sets the stage, so to speak. Then we can use any of Tailwind's transform classes we want. (The way they made that work using CSS variables is pretty ingenius if you ask me.)</p>
            <h3><code>transform skew-y-12</code></h3>
            <p>For this demo I chose <code>skew-y-12</code>, which skews the element by 12 degrees along the Y axis (up/down). I actually need 14 for my project, but that gets into customizing Tailwind, which is beyond the scope of this demo. So 12 degrees will do, and we just have to remember that number when we add our Tailwind classes.</p>
          </div>

        <div class="column relative overflow-hidden md:overflow-visible px-7 lg:px-14">
          <div class="transform -skew-y-12 pt-7 md:tri-pt z-1">
            <h3>Nesting and Inheritance</h3>
            <p>Transforms behave like they are inherited, in a sense, even though technically they're not. When you apply any transform to an element (skew, rotate, scale, etc.), all content within is also transformed in that way. So in order to skew a box and not it's content we have to "unskew" that content. So we need the opposite of a 12 degree skew, which would be -12 degrees. With Tailwind, all we have to do to convert a value to negative is add a hyphen (-) in font of it.</p>
            <p><code>transform -skew-y-12</code></p>
            <p>If we then want to "reskew" something nested with that, we simply use the first set of classes again.</p>

            <h2>Tilted Boxes</h2>
            <p>You can immediatly see the difference "tilted" boxes have from "slanted" when you introduce columns (which you'll only see here on widers screens). It's almost such a different look that you could arguably say don't go together, design-wise. It's obvious with anything else box shaped as well, such as images. But certainly it's a really cool look on its own and quite popular, as can be observed in much of today's marketing. I'm a fan of it myself, so I wanted to do something to make its many caveats easier to cope with.</p>

            <h3><code>transform rotate-12</code></h3>
            <p>Just like the "slanted" box, all we need is Tailwinds transform classes, but this time we use rotation. And again, to "unrotate" what's inside we just add that hyphen in front of the <code>rotate-12</code> class</p>
            <p><code>transform -rotate-12</code></p>
            <p>If we do want to combine slanting and rotating, and we want a consistent angle throughout the page, the skew and rotate values match, so we're sticking with 12 degrees for tilting as well, here.</p>

            <h3>Tilt Caveats</h3>
            <p>Because tilted boxes are actually rotated, we now get into some problematic geometry, some of which CSS provides little to no access to resolve mathmatically. Rotating a tall block of text for instance means one verticle end (top or bottom) swings off in one direction and the alternate end swings off the other way, naturally.</p>
            <p>To compound the matter, text blocks are very frequently much taller and narrower on mobile devices than on devices with wider screens. It seems rotation is also harder for the system to calculate than skewing is.</p>
            <p>For these reasons, I would recommend reserving "tilting" for wider devices, as much as possible. This is one of the first areas where Tailwind really shines, with its media query syntax.</p>

        <div class="column relative overflow-hidden md:overflow-visible px-7 md:pr-14 lg:px-14">

          <div class="transform italic md:not-italic relative tri-py">
            <h4>Media Queries</h4>
            <p>With Tailwind, simply prepend <code>md:</code> to the class you only want applied to the medium breakpoint on up, or use another one of its breakpoint specifier (<code>sm:</code>, <code>lg:</code>, <code>xl:</code>, <code>2xl:</code>). Example:</p>
            <p><code>skew-y-12 md:skew-y-0 md:rotate-12</code></p>
            <p>The above classes will skew 12 degrees (on the Y axis), then "unskew" and rotate 12 degrees at the medium breakpoint. "Unskewing" is necessary as both skew and rotate can be applied concurrently. Neither one overrides the other. In this way, we are following a mobile-first principle, as <code>skew-y-12</code> is set for all devices, and the rest is ignored by the smaller devices. Smaller devices would be more prone to exhibiting a lag when having to process overrides, so we let larger, more powerful devices deal with that.</p>
            <p>I've designed most of these clases to follow the same pattern and use these same breakpoint prefixes.</p>

            <h4>Box Corners</h4>
            <p>We can (and should) avoid making our tilted boxes too tall, or break their inner content into short boxes, individually rotated. However, even if we do this, we will have protruding box corners with anything we rotate (because everything in HTML is box shaped, even if you can't see it). To deal with this, the best solution I have found is to cut the corners off with a wrapper, using <code>overflow-hidden</code> (a Tailwind class).</p>

            <h2>Triangular Padding</h2>
            <p>Tailwind's default measurement system mostly uses <code>rem</code> units. This is fine in most cases, but not very practical for maintaining our necessary aspect-ratio. You could customize Tailwind to use something like <code>vw</code> or <code>cqw</code>, but this isn't recommended. Generally, Tailwind should be used as-is and only added to, if anything. Tailwind allows us to use arbitrary values in our HTML such as <code>pt-[12cqw]</code> (<code>padding-top: 12cqw;</code>), and that may be considered better practice. I'm not a fan of the idea, myself. To adhere to an aspect-ratio, the container width needs to be observed so the proper space can be calculated accordingly. We really need to use the <code>cqw</code> unit or at least <code>vw</code>. Without this, the tops and bottoms of the tilted or slanted elements will either be too big on some devices, or the text will spill out on other devices, or both.</p>

          <p>So our first custom class will address the triangular space we get from skewing and rotating. Now to make it easy-ish to remember these new classes, and since most classes used in the project are those of Tailwind, let's follow Tailwind's syntax as much as we can. Tailwind syntax is short, so for "triangular space" let's just use <code>tri-</code>. Then, as this is a type of padding, let's borrow Tailwind's <code>pt</code>, <code>pb</code>, etc. And since this is custom, we don't need to support tons of variants like <code>tri-pt-6</code>, <code>tri-pt-7</code>, ..., etc. Let's just use the container aspect-ratio that will work for our project, which in this case is <code>12cqw</code>. (I just played around with it to find that number, but usually this would be close to the number of degrees you are using for your slants and tilts.)</p>

        <div class="column transform -skew-y-12 px-7 lg:px-14 tri-py md:tri-pt-0">
          <p>Here are the classes for the job:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><code>tri-pt</code> = <code>padding-top: var(--triangle-pos);</code></li>
            <li><code>tri-pb</code> = <code>padding-bottom: var(--triangle-pos);</code></li>
            <li><code>tri-py</code> = <code>padding-top: var(--triangle-pos); padding-bottom: var(--triangle-pos);</code></li>
          </ul>
          <p><code>var(--triangle-pos)</code> is a CSS variable I set, which equals <code>12cqw</code>. This should generate the right amount of padding for the triangular space, based upon the width of the container element.</p>

        <h2>Containers and Query Units</h2>
        <p>Note that this (the above, regarding <code>cqw</code>) means the container has to be a container. Yep, it's a thing, and it's not just any old wrapper. A container is explicitly declared as such. Otherwise, how would container query units (<code>cqh</code>, <code>cqw</code> and <code>cqi</code>) know which "container" to base itself on when it's nested multiple levels deep. If it were to always based itself on the size of its immediate parent (which is what I thought it did), that would be useless in some situations, or could get very messy as we would tend to declare too many containers. Fortunately, the viewport essentially acts as though it is automatically declared as a container, meaning if you have no containers defined, <code>cqw</code> equates to <code>vw</code>, <code>cqh</code> equates to <code>vh</code>, etc.

          <h2>Columns</h2>
          <p>Here we've created a <code>column</code> class with <code>container-type: inline-size</code>, which gives us something to reference for the size of the triangular padding, rather than referring to the viewport size. I wasn't able to find a Tailwind class to set the container-type (maybe because it's pretty new), hence I created my own. Because of this, I made my <code>column</code> class serve several other purposes.</p>

            <h2>Background Images</h2>
            <p>Background colors are straightforward, but when adding images to these boxes we need to understand how they are affected by the transforms. For instance, if you add a CSS background image to a tilted (rotated) box, the image will be tilted along with it. This may be just what we want in some cases, which is great! If not, the image will need to be placed on (or in) a box that is "untilted" (rotated in the reverse direction, so as to straighten it out again).</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="column relative content-center px-7 lg:px-14">

          </div>
          <div class="relative -skew-y-12 transform md:skew-y-0 tri-pb md:tri-py">
            <p>Now when we have a straightened or untilted image inside a tilted box we often get the corner problem again. That is, the image corners want to spill out. In some cases we can fix this by adding <code>overflow-hidden</code>, to the tilted box. But depending on your edge case, there may still be another "corner" problem (or more of a "hole" problem).</p>

        <div class="column content-center transform -skew-y-12 md:skew-y-0 px-7 lg:px-14">
          <div class="tri-pb md:tri-py">
            <p>In probably most cases, we want the image to fill the container, but an untilted image inside a tilted box leaves holes. And this is the case even with all the CSS we normally use to make an image fill an area. CSS doesn't see what we see. If you tell it to rotate something, it just rotates it in place. It sees no consequential need to resize anything if we didn't ask it to. So to force the image to occupy those holes, we have to tell the browser to scale it up larger than the tilted box it sits within.</p>

            <p class="pb-4 md:pb-0">Adding a dedicated element for it is often the best way to generating a background in these boxes. We just need to treat it as its own layer and ensure that it sits beneath the forground content. Scaling a background image can be done in several ways, but the most challenging aspects of it are balancing "enough" scaling vs "too much", and for any variety of screen sizes, without stretching the image.</p>

            <p>I'll spare the details of how I derived the CSS for it, but I created a class for that:</p>
            <p><code>tri-cover</code></p>
            <p>It works in most cases, but it's far from perfect. There's some compromise (usually a little more upscaling than necessary) and sometimes the image gets stretched (mostly only those with portrait orientation). I might play around with this class more at some point, because I feel like there has to be some way to base it on the container's height as well as the width.</p>

            <h3>Backgrounds in Columns</h3>
            <p class="pb-4 md:pb-0">For the most part, we can get the background to fill a column with positioning, hiding overflow and sometimes upscaling. But in a tilted row, the first and last columns tend to have holes (or gaps, I suppose). Rotating the box moves some of the corners outward (as we have covered above), but what about the opposing corners that are brought inward? This doesn't harm scrolling, but it unsightly, isn't it?</p>

            <p>So I created classes for that too:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><code>reach</code></li>
              <li><code>reach-left</code></li>
              <li><code>reach-left</code></li>
              <li><code>reach-0</code></li>
              <li><code>reach-right-0</code></li>
              <li><code>reach-right-0</code></li>
            </ul>
            <p>The <code>*-0</code> classes are for overriding the others at higher breakpoints. So <code>md:reach-left</code> won't start doing it's thing until the medium breakpoint, then if you needed to deactivate that at the next breakpoint you could use <code>lg:reach-left-0</code>.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="column transform -skew-y-12 md:skew-y-0 md:-rotate-12 px-7 lg:px-14">
          <div class="tri-pb md:tri-py">
            <p>The way these work is by simply stretching the side edges out beyond their boundaries (by 50% of the container width) and then adding that much padding on that edge. The background, if properly set up, ignores the padding and bleeds off the page like with the box, while the inner content is remains constrained by the box within the padding.</p>

            <h2>Variables</h2>
            <p>I love CSS variables. You can of course modify this css for your project if you choose to use it, but I used variables a lot to automatically calculate certain spacing and positioning properties. This makes it very easy to modify all of this for other projects, or at least if you need to change the angle. So if you want to use Tailwind's <code>skew-y-6</code> (instead of <code>skew-y-12</code>), you can likely change the variables to <code>--angle-pos: 6deg</code>, <code>--angle-neg: -6deg</code>, <code>--triangle-pos: 6cqw</code>, and you should have all the right triangle padding, triangle background "cover" (fill), etc. (Or you shouldn't have to adjust much from there).</p>

          <div class="tri-pb pt-4 md:tri-py">
            <p>To follow the patterns of Tailwind more closely, these classes could have been written with numeric variants, like <code>tri-py-3</code>, instead of basing it all on these variables. Perhaps there is a good way to programatically do that in a tailwind.config file. But here on Codepen, supporting the same numeric increments as Tailwind would require a great deal of additional SCSS, and that is definitely not the point of this demonstration.</p>
